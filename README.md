A minimalistic landing page about New York City focused on enticing tourists.

# Key Features
Built in a single evening, the NYC landing page was meant to be some independent practice for myself. Here are some the features and concepts I worked on:
- Used animations to cycle through different words and colors
- Used `mix-blend-mode` to invert the hero text animation when it appears on a different background color
- Styled (including the date input) and built a functional form 
- Mobile-responsive design
- Various usages of grid and flexbox containers
- Utilized CSS prefixes in order to allow browser support to animations & transitions
